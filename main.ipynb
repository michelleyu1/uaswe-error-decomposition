    "Because mountain snowpack and its melt dominate the surface hydrology of many regions, seasonal snowpack is an important water resource. It has strong implications for water supply, hydropower, ecological processes, weather, recreation, and regional and global climate. Seasonal snowpack is quantified through snow water equivalent, or SWE. Formally, SWE is the amount of liquid water in a snowpack that would be formed if the snowpack were completely melted.\n",

    "While observation data provide incredible value, as they provide true groundtruth data, there exist some limitations. First, measurement errors inevitably occur, as mishaps with sensors or other equipment happen from time to time. Second, spatiotemporal gaps exist, since measurements taken at single point locations are intrinsically limited by a lack of confidence in how they capture the landscape mean across coarse grid cells (Meromy et al., 2012), which is particularly problematic in areas of mixed forest vegetation, open areas prone to wind redistribution, and complex topography (most snow-covered regions fall into at least one of these categories).\n",

    "Gridded products are immensely useful; however, there still exist limitations. First, many methods, such as Livneh and UA SWE, that utilize point measurements include some kind of smoothing or interpolation in the gridding process. These assumptions add additional uncertainty, at times up to 60% of differences observed in estimates of Western US wide peak SWE (Siirla, Rhoades, et al. (2019)). Furthermore, methods, such as Livneh and ERA5, utilize a physical model in the gridding procedure. The use of such models also adds uncertainty and error to the final estimates. Additionally, spatial variability in SWE due to topographic and land cover heterogeneity cannot be adequately captured by data with relatively coarse spatial resolution. Related to the relatively coarse spatial resolution, another limitation lies in the limited ability of gridded products to estimate extremes.  "

    "To quantify the error contributed by each source of uncertainty, we focus on the PRISM net snowfall component in the UA SWE algorithm. We can think of the error decomposition setup as building blocks adding steps of error components. At the base is SNOTEL observed SWE, which equates to using SNOTEL T and P data instead of PRISM data to compute the PRISM net snowfall component (when the interpolation of SNOTEL ratios is ignored). The next step is the SWE as estimated by UA SWE, which equates to using PRISM T and P data to compute PRISM net snowfall. The next step beyond that consists of either using gridMET/Livneh T and/or P data instead of PRISM data, or using the variable Jennings rain-snow partitioning threshold instead of the $2^\\circ$C assumption, to compute the PRISM net snowfall component.\n",

    "    - Resolution could partially explain why UA SWE underestimates SNOTEL SWE at SNOTEL sites.\n",
    "* Precipitation is the dominant factor that impacts the variability in UA SWE early in the snow season; as ablation begins to increase in October, temperature becomes the dominant factor influencing UA SWE variability. This influence persists throughout the rest of the snow season. This is because early in the season, snow accumulation plays a dominant role and precipitation data only plays a role in affecting snow accumulation; however, ablation begins to accumulate around mid-October and since ablation is solely determined by temperature data in UA SWE, temperature begins to play a increasingly larger role in influencing UA SWE variability beginning around mid-October.\n",
    "* Because Jennings rain-snow partitioning threshold is greater than $2^\\circ$C in the UCRB, using a dynamic rain-snow partitioning scheme does not significantly affect or improve UA SWE estimates.\n",
    "* Using gridMET or Livneh precipitation in lieu of PRISM precipitation in UA SWE increases SWE error, on average.\n",
    "* Using gridMET or Livneh temperature in lieu of PRISM temperature in UA SWE reduces the SWE error, on average.\n",
    "    - In particular, because of Livneh temperature lapse rate correction (i.e. correcting for elevation), UA SWE produced with Livneh T in place of PRISM T reduces the SWE error in relation to SNOTEL. This suggests a benefit in Livneh's decision to correct temperature with a lapse rate.\n",
    "* Our method allows us to evaluate the individual efffects of the because the interaction between T and P masks the individual effects in different ways. In gridMET, for example, the interaction between T and P cancel out the positive and negative errors produced by the individual T and P components. In Livneh, however, the interaction effect is additive/multiplicative."

These biases will reach beyond mountain areas, affecting assessment of water resources and hydrologic hazards for regions downstream.\" (Wrzesien et al. (2019))\n",

Precipitation also contributes to the uncertainty, but its major influence lies in the beginning of the snow season before ablation begins.\n",
